# Zapier lab — build an action-taking assistant

**Audience:** Founders, owners, and small-business executives  
**Prerequisites:** None

## What you’ll learn
- Publish a working assistant that drafts emails and updates CRM
- Add an approval step and a rollback plan
- Measure time saved and error rate

## Key topics we cover
- Connector selection and OAuth scopes
- Triggers, actions, searches, and agents
- Human-in-the-loop approvals and drafts
- Error handling, retries, and logging

## Executive overview
This lesson translates complex AI concepts into practical management decisions. We focus on how to evaluate opportunities, reduce risk, and move from pilot experiments to measurable, repeatable workflows. You’ll see what matters strategically, what can be delegated, and what to insist on when teams propose AI-enabled solutions.


## How it works (plain-English)
We keep the mechanics simple: inputs (your task, data, rules) go into a model or agent, the system reasons with tools and constraints, and then returns an output. When the task requires action—sending emails, updating a CRM, generating documents—an **automation layer** or **agent runtime** executes steps under guardrails (permissions, reviews, logs).

## Common pitfalls to avoid
- Skipping approval steps for outbound actions
- Silent failures without alerts

## What to measure
- End-to-end run time, success/failure rate, human edits


## Next steps
Run the associated hands‑on exercise and capture baseline metrics this week. Bring at least one “keep/kill/iterate” decision to the next session.
