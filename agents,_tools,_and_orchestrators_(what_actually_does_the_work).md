# Agents, tools, and orchestrators (what actually does the work)

**Audience:** Founders, owners, and small-business executives  
**Prerequisites:** None

## What you’ll learn
- Map tasks to agents vs. deterministic automations
- Design guardrails for action-taking systems
- Select an execution layer that fits your risk profile

## Key topics we cover
- Agent loops, memory, retrieval, and tool use
- Choosing runtime: SaaS vs. self-hosted vs. API
- Human-in-the-loop controls and approvals
- Observability: logs, traces, and red-teaming

## Executive overview
This lesson translates complex AI concepts into practical management decisions. We focus on how to evaluate opportunities, reduce risk, and move from pilot experiments to measurable, repeatable workflows. You’ll see what matters strategically, what can be delegated, and what to insist on when teams propose AI-enabled solutions.


## How it works (plain-English)
We keep the mechanics simple: inputs (your task, data, rules) go into a model or agent, the system reasons with tools and constraints, and then returns an output. When the task requires action—sending emails, updating a CRM, generating documents—an **automation layer** or **agent runtime** executes steps under guardrails (permissions, reviews, logs).

## Common pitfalls to avoid
- Unbounded autonomy without checkpoints
- Opaque vendor defaults; no audit trail
- Skipping sandbox tests before production

## What to measure
- Intervention rate, rollback safety, audit completeness
- Mean time to detect (MTTD) and repair (MTTR)


## Next steps
Run the associated hands‑on exercise and capture baseline metrics this week. Bring at least one “keep/kill/iterate” decision to the next session.
