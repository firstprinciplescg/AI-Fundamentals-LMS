# ROI, risk, and portfolio planning for AI initiatives

**Audience:** Founders, owners, and small-business executives  
**Prerequisites:** None

## What you’ll learn
- Turn AI from scattered experiments into a road map
- Make transparent trade-offs with leadership
- Measure value creation in cycles, not years

## Key topics we cover
- Opportunity scoring and cost-of-delay
- Build vs. buy vs. integrate decisions
- Pilot design and portfolio balancing
- Value tracking and benefits realization

## Executive overview
This lesson translates complex AI concepts into practical management decisions. We focus on how to evaluate opportunities, reduce risk, and move from pilot experiments to measurable, repeatable workflows. You’ll see what matters strategically, what can be delegated, and what to insist on when teams propose AI-enabled solutions.


## How it works (plain-English)
We keep the mechanics simple: inputs (your task, data, rules) go into a model or agent, the system reasons with tools and constraints, and then returns an output. When the task requires action—sending emails, updating a CRM, generating documents—an **automation layer** or **agent runtime** executes steps under guardrails (permissions, reviews, logs).

## Common pitfalls to avoid
- Over-scoping first pilots; hero projects
- Ignoring change management and training
- No benefit tracking; savings vanish

## What to measure
- Cycle time to first win, $ value per release
- Adoption and utilization metrics


## Next steps
Run the associated hands‑on exercise and capture baseline metrics this week. Bring at least one “keep/kill/iterate” decision to the next session.
