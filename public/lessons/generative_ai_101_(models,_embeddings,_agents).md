# Generative AI 101 (models, embeddings, agents)

**Audience:** Founders, owners, and small-business executives  
**Prerequisites:** None

## What you’ll learn
- Explain AI building blocks in plain English
- Identify where generative AI helps or hurts
- Know when to choose assistants vs. automations
- Ask the five right questions before any pilot

## Key topics we cover
- Foundation model basics and when size matters
- Embeddings for search, clustering, and RAG
- Agents vs. automations vs. copilots
- Tool use, function calling, and constraints
- Vendor landscape and evaluation lenses

## Executive overview
This lesson translates complex AI concepts into practical management decisions. We focus on how to evaluate opportunities, reduce risk, and move from pilot experiments to measurable, repeatable workflows. You’ll see what matters strategically, what can be delegated, and what to insist on when teams propose AI-enabled solutions.


## How it works (plain-English)
We keep the mechanics simple: inputs (your task, data, rules) go into a model or agent, the system reasons with tools and constraints, and then returns an output. When the task requires action—sending emails, updating a CRM, generating documents—an **automation layer** or **agent runtime** executes steps under guardrails (permissions, reviews, logs).

## Common pitfalls to avoid
- Chasing novelty over business value
- Letting models see sensitive data by default
- No baselines; no way to measure improvement

## What to measure
- Time saved per task, error rates vs. baseline
- Win rate on pilot candidates (keep/kill/iterate)


## Next steps
Run the associated hands‑on exercise and capture baseline metrics this week. Bring at least one “keep/kill/iterate” decision to the next session.
