# Gemini overview (multimodality, Google ecosystem)

**Audience:** Founders, owners, and small-business executives  
**Prerequisites:** None

## What you’ll learn
- Leverage Google workspace with minimal glue code
- Automate document processing and routing
- Use image understanding for back-office

## Key topics we cover
- Native multimodality: text, image, audio
- Docs/Sheets/Gmail integration patterns
- Vision-based document understanding
- Admin and data region controls

## Executive overview
This lesson translates complex AI concepts into practical management decisions. We focus on how to evaluate opportunities, reduce risk, and move from pilot experiments to measurable, repeatable workflows. You’ll see what matters strategically, what can be delegated, and what to insist on when teams propose AI-enabled solutions.


## How it works (plain-English)
We keep the mechanics simple: inputs (your task, data, rules) go into a model or agent, the system reasons with tools and constraints, and then returns an output. When the task requires action—sending emails, updating a CRM, generating documents—an **automation layer** or **agent runtime** executes steps under guardrails (permissions, reviews, logs).

## Common pitfalls to avoid
- Loose governance on shared drives
- Unreviewed automation of email actions
- No exception handling for failures

## What to measure
- Throughput per doc, false-positive rate, rework


## Next steps
Run the associated hands‑on exercise and capture baseline metrics this week. Bring at least one “keep/kill/iterate” decision to the next session.
