# Claude overview (analysis, drafting, reliability patterns)

**Audience:** Founders, owners, and small-business executives  
**Prerequisites:** None

## What you’ll learn
- Use for deep analysis and structured outputs
- Reduce hallucinations with explicit rubrics
- Enable doc analysis with clear constraints

## Key topics we cover
- Long-context reasoning for synthesis
- File packs and structured analysis prompts
- Safety defaults and conservative behavior
- Enterprise controls and red-teaming hooks

## Executive overview
This lesson translates complex AI concepts into practical management decisions. We focus on how to evaluate opportunities, reduce risk, and move from pilot experiments to measurable, repeatable workflows. You’ll see what matters strategically, what can be delegated, and what to insist on when teams propose AI-enabled solutions.


## How it works (plain-English)
We keep the mechanics simple: inputs (your task, data, rules) go into a model or agent, the system reasons with tools and constraints, and then returns an output. When the task requires action—sending emails, updating a CRM, generating documents—an **automation layer** or **agent runtime** executes steps under guardrails (permissions, reviews, logs).

## Common pitfalls to avoid
- Under-specifying tasks; vague outcomes
- Pasting sensitive data without policies
- Skipping golden-answer checks

## What to measure
- Agreement with reference sources, edit rate


## Next steps
Run the associated hands‑on exercise and capture baseline metrics this week. Bring at least one “keep/kill/iterate” decision to the next session.
