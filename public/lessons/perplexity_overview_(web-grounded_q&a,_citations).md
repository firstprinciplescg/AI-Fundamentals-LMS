# Perplexity overview (web-grounded Q&A, citations)

**Audience:** Founders, owners, and small-business executives  
**Prerequisites:** None

## What you’ll learn
- Use for market/tech scans with sources
- Rapid literature reviews and summaries
- Bridge to LLMs with grounded context

## Key topics we cover
- Pro Search and web-grounded answers
- Model selection and file analysis patterns
- Citation-first research workflows
- API for retrieval-heavy assistants

## Executive overview
This lesson translates complex AI concepts into practical management decisions. We focus on how to evaluate opportunities, reduce risk, and move from pilot experiments to measurable, repeatable workflows. You’ll see what matters strategically, what can be delegated, and what to insist on when teams propose AI-enabled solutions.


## How it works (plain-English)
We keep the mechanics simple: inputs (your task, data, rules) go into a model or agent, the system reasons with tools and constraints, and then returns an output. When the task requires action—sending emails, updating a CRM, generating documents—an **automation layer** or **agent runtime** executes steps under guardrails (permissions, reviews, logs).

## Common pitfalls to avoid
- Treating answers as gospel; always verify
- Over-automating without human review

## What to measure
- Source coverage, duplicate source rate, time saved


## Next steps
Run the associated hands‑on exercise and capture baseline metrics this week. Bring at least one “keep/kill/iterate” decision to the next session.
