# ChatGPT overview (strengths, guardrails, patterns)

**Audience:** Founders, owners, and small-business executives  
**Prerequisites:** None

## What you’ll learn
- Pick repeatable patterns that non-technical staff can run
- Use projects to standardize prompts and files
- Integrate safely with your data and apps

## Key topics we cover
- Projects/workspaces and shareable workflows
- Realtime/voice and tool use for action-taking
- Grounding with documents and structured data
- Team governance and policy settings

## Executive overview
This lesson translates complex AI concepts into practical management decisions. We focus on how to evaluate opportunities, reduce risk, and move from pilot experiments to measurable, repeatable workflows. You’ll see what matters strategically, what can be delegated, and what to insist on when teams propose AI-enabled solutions.


## How it works (plain-English)
We keep the mechanics simple: inputs (your task, data, rules) go into a model or agent, the system reasons with tools and constraints, and then returns an output. When the task requires action—sending emails, updating a CRM, generating documents—an **automation layer** or **agent runtime** executes steps under guardrails (permissions, reviews, logs).

## Common pitfalls to avoid
- Mixing personal and company accounts
- Insufficient reviews before enabling actions
- No logging while acting in other apps

## What to measure
- Adoption, task success rate, policy compliance
