# Claude — Founder Cheat Sheet

## Capabilities at a glance
- Long-context reasoning and summarization
- Structured analysis from large file packs
- Conservative safety defaults

## Ideal use cases
- Deep synthesis, requirements, and policy drafting
- Comparative analyses and insight packs
- RAG-style doc review with rubric scoring

## Poor fit / watch‑outs
- Very short, tactical copy where style matters
- Tasks requiring proprietary tool actions without integration

## Quick‑start checklist
1. Load reference docs; define rubric
2. Draft → evaluate → iterate workflow
2. Record assumptions and unresolved questions

## Notes
- Prefer explicit evaluation rubrics for critical work
