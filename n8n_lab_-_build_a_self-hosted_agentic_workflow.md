# n8n lab — build a self-hosted agentic workflow

**Audience:** Founders, owners, and small-business executives  
**Prerequisites:** None

## What you’ll learn
- Deploy a private, auditable workflow
- Integrate AI reasoning with deterministic steps
- Set up logs and health checks

## Key topics we cover
- Self-hosting basics and credentials vault
- HTTP nodes, code nodes, AI/agent nodes
- Data validation and schema checks
- Observability and version control

## Executive overview
This lesson translates complex AI concepts into practical management decisions. We focus on how to evaluate opportunities, reduce risk, and move from pilot experiments to measurable, repeatable workflows. You’ll see what matters strategically, what can be delegated, and what to insist on when teams propose AI-enabled solutions.


## How it works (plain-English)
We keep the mechanics simple: inputs (your task, data, rules) go into a model or agent, the system reasons with tools and constraints, and then returns an output. When the task requires action—sending emails, updating a CRM, generating documents—an **automation layer** or **agent runtime** executes steps under guardrails (permissions, reviews, logs).

## Common pitfalls to avoid
- Hard-coding secrets; no vault
- No tests or mocks for API failures

## What to measure
- Uptime, run success %, mean recovery time


## Next steps
Run the associated hands‑on exercise and capture baseline metrics this week. Bring at least one “keep/kill/iterate” decision to the next session.
